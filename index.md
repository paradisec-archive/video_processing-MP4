## Using **FFmpeg** on a Mac

### Installation
FFmpeg is an efficient and cost effective way to process video. It is done by using a Command Line Interface (CLI), but once the workflow is set up, it is relatively simple.

If you are using a Mac, it is a bit more straight forward than the PC as Bash is a Unix shell (command language interpreter) and runs natively on Macs. To download FFmpeg, open a terminal window and first install Homebrew (command line package manager) with the following commands:

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) 

``` /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"```

2. Run Brew Doctor. This is a self-diagnostic tool to determine if everything is installed correctly.

``` brew doctor```

3. Install FFmpeg
```brew install ffmpeg```
